                <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>

                <p class="blog-text">
                    Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people because many can get fixed within the ideas and concepts that your intelligence and ability is fixed. This is a toxic and negative but relatively easy trap to fall into, therefore it's important to remain cognizant of the FACT that your intelligence is malleable and come be increased, you are not permanently limited at your current abilities.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-text">
                    A great way to engage with neuroplasticity is to as mentioned remind yourself a couple times a day, ask yourself what you are doing and how you can increase your intelligence. If you are looking to actually increase your neuroplasticity then there are two great ways I would recommend. These are visualization and grouping.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-text">
                    Visualization involves sitting or lying down and imagining doing a task you would like to improve in. This has been scientifically proven to help, a great study referenced to in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ngs5_WXxfo"> Neuroplasticity Video </a> where a study had two group practice piano for two hours daily however one group only could visualize playing and couldnâ€™t touch the piano. After Five days both groups had the same physical changes in brain and same accuracy, after five the group that actually played piano managed to pull ahead a bit however the visualization group caught up quickly when given the chance to actually play.

                <p class="blog-text">
                    Another technique is grouping, a wonderful phrase to help remember this technique is "Cells that fire together wire together." This technique involve practice and repetition to build up the focused skill and then also bringing any information you learn into context because this helps form stronger neural connects, allows for more brain cell activity, and finally more successful long te4rm memory storage and retrieval. To reiterate grouping is about practice/repetition and pulling information into context with other things. For Example for coding rather should I want to learn more than rather than just watch someone code a small chunk of code, then I could instead code myself (incorporating typing, thinking, and using systems) to then build on that I could try implement code, such actions would be grouping and have previously detailed benefits.

                <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>

                <p class="blog-text">
                    There are two mindsets one can have when learning. The first is a fixed mindset in that the individual believes that they cannot learn or grow outside of their current abilities/knowledge.  The second is a growth mindset which is essentially the inverse wherein an individual believes they can grow and improve.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-text">
                    I was personally surprised at how much improvement could be achieved all from having a better mindset. Because a growth mindset is really just how you mentally frame things and deal with difficult situations. It's about seeing barriers or problems as opportunities to grow and improve.
                </p>

                <p class="blog-text">
                    For me, I am going to incorporate a growth mindset into my learning journey by trying my best when it gets difficult to remind myself that this is the best time for me to make some great mental progress and really improve.
                </p>

                <h3>Learning Plan and Strategies</h3>

                <p class="blog-text">
                    I will incorporate such practices into my new daily cycle by at the start and end reminding myself in the morning and evening about neuroplasticity and then when facing challenges that wear me down mentally, I shall then attempt to combat such thoughts with a positive growth mindset. Reminding myself to use the opportunity to better myself.
