                        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?    -   Ive learnt that I don’t just have a growth or fixed mindset but rather it depends on what I'm doing, I have realized how difficult I find it to stay present and focused to a high level, finally I learned that my intelligence isn't fixed.
                    </p>

                        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?    -   Being empathetic and nice to yourself when things are getting confusing and taking a positive approach has seemingly endless benefits, being self-aware to me means in this sense realizing where you are within your career and coding journey and knowing that while it would be awesome to code super-fizz-buzz right away it would just be unrealistic to have the knowledge to instantly crack it without some deep thoughts and confusion.

                        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?    -   Again I was just really surprised of how beneficial it is to have a positive outlook on life but specifically when facing challenges, really just seeing it as a chance to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?   -   I didn’t feel like I struggled with anything too much however it was still difficult to admit my flaws.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?   -   I think in general it is important to have good eq skills to be a good person but also its integral to the IT industry because people obviously want to work with good people.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.   -   I feel like I put in enough time to make it worth it however not so much that it detracted from my coding. I think if I had spent way more time on core then I would have felt like I didn’t use my time to the best of my advantage.
