                        What is Emotional Intelligence? Emotional intelligence is about an individual being in touch with their feeling, thoughts, and headspace, however not only for them but also able to recognize and understand such things within others too.

                        How is it different to IQ? One could compare the difference between EQ and IQ as akin to that between street smarts and book smarts. IQ is far more of gathering an understanding for an individual's ability for reasoning, and ability to formulate and understand difficult concepts, whereas EQ looks far more into skills required to be socialable and in touch with others and one's self.

                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Why is it important? EQ is important because as humans are social and thrive off the connections and relationships we form. Being able to read and understand yourself and others are very important things to be able to do. A key factor in this ever-growing-more-connected world is relationships, to be successful one must be in tune with themselves and also able to tune into others. Itâ€™s a very valuable skill not just in life sense but business specifically too.
