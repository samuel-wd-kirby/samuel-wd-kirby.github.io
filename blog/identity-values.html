                  <p class="blog-text">I would describe my personal values as Decisiveness, Knowledge, Detachment, Growth, Creativity, Loyalty, Hedonism. I had a situation in which I found out about some bad acts someone had done and this someone was close with my friends. I was unsure whether to tell them or not as I was concerned and although it could ruin their friendship with this someone I decided it was important to let them know of this persons bad history. I did this because from a loyalty standpoint I would want someone to do this for me. I felt it important to share this knowledge and from a detached point of view with getting emotional I deemed it important to inform them for their safety, I also was decisive as I didn’t have the luxury of dragging out the decision making process.

                    I don’t have a very strong culture however what I can speak to for influencing my values and identity is the type of environment my parents created. It was the type of environment that supported and rewarded growth and improvement but also ownership and individuality. I feel it was very critical in developing the key good values I have at the moment.

                    I would describe my strengths as being Empathetic, Generous, Open-minded, Creative, Passionate, and Idealistic. Some of my limitations would be being Unrealistic, Self-isolating, Unfocused (at times), Emotionally vulnerable, Tendency to want to please others, and very Self-critical. Obviously my strengths help me progress a lot in my career development and in my learning, and conversely my weakness slightly impede this progression. Specifically I think being openminded, creative and passionate will all by huge positives to helping me in my learning journey. I can use my being passionate to push through difficult task whilst using open-mindedness and creativity to think outside the box should challenges or learning obstacles arise.
                    
                    I can recall having to deal with several flatting conversations in which we were all trying to productively work towards a conclusion. Things started getting more heated and in order to calm things I proposed we take turns speaking and let them speak first, this helped because It made them feel heard and they got a chance to explain their reasoning. At the end of them talking I ended up asking some questions and through doing this actually pointed out some of the logic gaps that they had failed to properly think about. I think the strategy of letting both sides talk and enquiring about each other's thinking is the best way to go about conflict resolution and try gain some understanding for both sides. If I were to do it again now I would have also suggested a method in which prior to one talking they need to recite the general gist of the others argument because that way there is a lot of clarity. Lack of clarity in thoughts was a key problem experienced in this situation.
