                    <h3>After getting blocked on a problem</h3>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        What was the problem? - It was adding code to finish off a game. I had to add an event listener. This is just code that acts when its "event" occurs, for example 'onclick' so when said item is clicked then the code will run. It was a straight forward problem however I made the mistake of miss-spelling the 'event', I was meant to write 'dblclick' however I wrote 'dbclick'.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        What problem solving techniques did you use? I used the rubber ducky technique but that was of no avail and tried to ask my peers, unfortunately with my luck I realized my mistake right after posting which was very unfortunate.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        How did you feel throughout the process? I felt calm for the most part with rising tension and confusion until I realized my mistake.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        What did you learn? It is very important to read through your code, Carefully!!!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Solved a problem Elegantly</h3>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        What was the problem? The problem I ran into was reversing a string, essentially it was like trying to reverse a sentience so it all reads backwards.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">   
                        What problem solving techniques did you use? I struggled to wrap my head around it and then decided to google and search up the separate parts of it all. Through finding out different sections I managed to add it all up together and so it worked effectively. This was all very fun and good.                     
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        How did you feel throughout the process? It all felt pretty smooth and I felt very confident.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        What did you learn? I learnt there is a lot of good information out there on the web that its very valuable to make good use of them.

                    <h3>Refleciton on Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Pseudocode - This helped a bit but I struggle at the moment to verbalize my thoughts which in turn leads to poorly detailed pseudocode.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Trying something - This method is helpful but has it limits, I would recommend using it for a bit but putting a time limit on it because other problem solving techniques may be way more helpful.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Rubber ducky method - I found this super helpful because explaining out loud for some reason seemed to work way better for me then pseudocode, I would definitely recommend.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Reading error messages - Error messages are very helpful to let you know what's up. If they have been detailed well then you can quickly make useful adjustments to rectify problems within your code.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Console.logging - I find console logging is has been a very useful method for me to ensure my output is correct, this can also be used in combination with reading any error messages that could apply to your code.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Googling - Now this is a true gem, I  have found it super useful, that may be just because I am starting out so there is so much still to learn but it has and is super useful.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Asking your peers for help - I found this a great thing to do because it has helped me strengthen connections to those within my cohort whilst also working together to find a solution.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Asking coaches for help - I've tried it once and it was super beneficial, got quick and accurate advice not answers which is important because then I still had to figure it out which I appreciated.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Improving your process with reflection - Reflection has been something Ive felt I have lacked in and would definitely like to do more of. When implemented properly reflection is very beneficial to understanding thinking as I know the code I have gone back over to try better internalize, it has been very helpful.
