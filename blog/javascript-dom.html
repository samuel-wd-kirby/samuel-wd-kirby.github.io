                    <h3>The Relationship Between HTML and CSS</h3>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        To describe the relationship and differences between HTML and CSS I would firstly fall back on two commonly used movie stereotypes, the first being that in high school there is always the popular social girl, and secondly there is always the high school nerd.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        HTML is like the nerd in that it knows all the stuff but has no EQ and just tells things the way they are. It doesn't hide anything and just lays everything down very factually. CSS is like the popular social girl in high school who also has great fashion taste. Fashion is far more finicky and not all outfits obviously look as good as you envision them to be! However when styled right it looks amazing. HTML and CSS working together nerd after the popular girl has given them a make-over. The nerd still tells it how it is but now he's all dressed up and looks great too, it should be mentioned the whole glow-up isnt instant and there's a lot of trial and failure but once you find the right style he looks amazing and still spits facts!
                    </p>
                    <h3>Control Flow and Loops</h3>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Control flow in JS refers to how the code runs top to bottom. The computer works its way down through the code in order, this could be seen as similar to putting on shoes, one works there way done the list of things to do, firstly socks must be put on prior to shoes, in code the command to put on socks would come before the command to put on shoes!
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Loops are another function within JS, Loops allow a sequence to repeat until a set limit. To relate this to an everyday life example it could be seen as brushing your teeth, you could brush once but rather you continue in a loop until you have brushed for two minutes which is the signal for you to finish your loop.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The DOM</h3>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        The DOM, which stands for Document Object Model, is a way to represent the webpage in a structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document. It has various uses but for programmers specifically one could make adjustments to a web page to view the resulting changes, the quick response time allows for fast return of information especially in design decision making.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Arrays and Objects</h3>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        In JavaScript Arrays are actually Objects too however there is a couple significant differences between the two. Firstly an object is a mutable data structure which is used to represent a 'thing', it stores a key value pair such as (name: Robin Williams). Conversely Arrays still mutable and used to store data however their data is stored in an ordered collection which is accessed through a numerical index.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Functions and their uses</h3>
                    <p class="blog-text">
                        Through Functions you define a block of code and give it a name, you can then execute this 'function' as many times as you would like. Functions are like specific building blocks, all with different compositions however when all used together you can build a strong and effective wall.
