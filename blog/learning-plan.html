                        IT/Tech is the future and its a great sector to be in. I personally just want to develop my talents and spend some time in the industry to see where I want to go and what I want to do. Long term it's pretty simple for me though, I want to end up somewhere that achieves three things: something I enjoy so good work life balance, something that challenges and pushes me, something where I can make a difference and help others.

                        A strength I have is that when it comes to learning once I get my head down and in the zone I do awesome and can really achieve/push through things however my weakness is I struggle to refocus once I get distracted, my productivity just lowers so much it's kind of crazy. I also can really hustle for something if needed. I think this is in line with something I would like to work on and that’s how to better switch from work mode to social mode because I love some good small chats but I want to learn how to be able to have those without it completely derailing my day.

                        I honestly just expect support should I need it and I trust in them to be able to asses where I'm at and help me improve to my best, provided I communicate well with them. I have no other commitments than this course, (basic necessities like meal prep, exercise and sleep but otherwise nothing hahha).

                        I see Dev Academy as my only real path forward for a job and as a result I am dedicated to achieving a good result. Keeping a good environment around me that is free of distractions and also music for coding to help me zone out of world and into code, when I need to. I enjoy being social and getting to better know my facilitator and cohort sounds great, furthermore I am far more of the mentality that if we all work together and bring each other up then we can succeed with greater quality and efficiency. My biggest thing to deal with stuff building up is I need to communicate, same with needing help. Communicate to my cohort, foundations channel, facilitator. Use the systems of support that are in place for a reason.

                        -     I see myself expanding from here to full stack, to cloud certs too likely for AWS but maybe AZURE and then also picking up a basic understanding of go-lang and c-# that along with also Vue.JS, that along with some cloud certs would be achievable within a year and from there I guess I'll see where I go, likely future business and chances to upskill within them will dictate this heavily. Obviously throughout this I'll continually add to my portfolio where I can with valuable additions.

                    <p class="blog-text">
                        -     I think it's still the same thing, when I get into the grind I thrive and do awesome, Its only when I don’t push as hard on the gas pedal is where problems start to arise so I need to be able to get better at my transitions from chill to working and back to become more effective for bootcamp and in life.

                        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

                    <p class="blog-text">
                        -     I would like to work on my negotiation and communication a bit more and also maybe a chance to understand leadership a bit better. I think a very big thing for me will be being able to not get too sucked into it all and lose a good work life balance.

                        -     Honestly just be there to help if I need, and you know be like that olive branch that you can grab onto if you're falling but also its higher enough that you really have to reach to get it, like you have to properly be needing it not just like every single hiccup, basically help if I need without too much scaffolding in less words… :)

                        -     I really want to be an asset to my team whilst upskilling and taking in as much as I can. I want to do my time and do really good hours, make a solid effort and remain focused,  and finally to be able to help, lead, and push others to succeed.
